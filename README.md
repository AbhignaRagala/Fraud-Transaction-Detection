# Fraud-Transaction-Detection


Abstract
Accurate identification of fraudulent credit card transactions is crucial for safeguarding
customers from unauthorized charges. Data Science, and specifically Machine Learning, play
an indispensable role in addressing this challenge. This project demonstrates the application
of machine learning to model a credit card fraud detection dataset. The task involves
constructing a model based on historical fraudulent transactions to classify new transactions
as fraudulent or legitimate. Our goal is to achieve a high fraud detection rate while
minimizing false positives.
Credit card fraud detection is a classic example of a classification problem. In this endeavor,
we explore data analysis, preprocessing, and the implementation of anomaly detection
algorithms on PCA-transformed credit card transaction data. We utilize various machine
learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and CATBoost. To address the issue of class imbalance,
Random Under Sampling (RUS) is applied, balancing the dataset by reducing the number of
legal transactions to match the number of fraudulent ones.
Our evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score,
ensuring a comprehensive assessment of model performance. The application of PCA helps
in reducing dimensionality and computational complexity, enhancing the overall
effectiveness of the models. This project underscores the potential of machine learning
techniques in detecting and preventing credit card fraud, ultimately contributing to more
secure financial transactions.
